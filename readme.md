## Source of the Dataset

The Dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at the following link:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

## Description
The dataset contains 13 features and a target variable indicating 
whether a patient has heart failure (1) or not (0). The features 
include demographic information, clinical measurements, and laboratory 
test results. The goal is to compare three different machine learning 
models at predicting heart failure based on these features.

## Features
- Age: Age of the patient
- Sex: Gender of the Parient
- ChestPainType: Type of chest pain experienced by the patient
- RestingBP: Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level
- FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar level
- RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results
- MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved
- ExerciseAngina: Exercise induced angina
- Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
